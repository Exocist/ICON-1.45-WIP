This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save. On a failed save, they stop and cannot move further with the same effect or ability.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Vigor X</strong>: Vigor <span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;display:inline !important;float:none\">grants whoever has it a shield over their HP, the value of which equals X times the target’s VIT.

When you take damage from an ability, pacify breaks.</p><p><strong>Shattered</strong>: Prevents you from gaining or benefiting from vigor.</p><p><strong>Slow</strong>: Forces you to take slow turns.</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Grants +1 boon to attacks made against you.</p><p><strong>Stunned</strong>: You must 1 less action on your next turn, then clear this status at the end of that turn.</p><p><strong>Winded</strong>: Prevents you from teleporting, dashing, and flying.</p><p><strong>Vulnerable</strong>: Increases all damage you take by 1.</p><hr /><p><strong>SPECIAL STATES</strong></p><p><strong>Bloodied</strong>: While you are at 50% or under HP, you are bloodied.</p><p><strong>Immobile</strong>: While immobile, you cannot move in any way.

A character can spend an action and a blessing token to <strong>cure </strong>themselves. All Mendicant jobs also have different ways to use blessings tokens.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> Charge abilities become more powerful or change in some way when used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured can immediately clear a status or blight. Then, if that character is bloodied, they gain vigor 1.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have <strong>two versions</strong>, a base version and combo version. When you use a base combo action, the next time you use any combo action, it uses its Combo version. When you use a Combo version of any combo action, the next combo action uses its base version.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow.</strong></p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> When you attack a bloodied foe, you score a finishing blow, dealing bonus damage. Your abilities with a Finishing Blow effects gain more powerful effects if their primary target is a bloodied foe, even if they are not an attack. Effects depend on the action.</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. For example, if a character is immune to damage or effects, it doesn't even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

For example, taking someone’s purse from them could be cutting it from their belt (with <strong>Excel</strong>) - quick but not necessarily quietly.</p><p>Alternately, it could be taking it quietly with <strong>Sneak</strong>. You could even perhaps <strong>Charm</strong> them to divert their attention while you take it off them. A heavy dungeon door could be <strong>Tinkered</strong> (if it has a lock). Alternately, it could be <strong>Smashed</strong> with a fireball, or perhaps someone could <strong>Endure</strong> lifting and holding it open for the group to pass through.</p><p>All of these different situations have different narrative outcomes and might be more risky or more or less effective depending on the situation. The key thing is that players always choose the <strong>approach and the action they want to use</strong>. The GM is free to suggest actions, and also to decide <strong>whether an action is more or less risky or effective</strong>. This is where the meat of narrative play in ICON lies. Players can use their creativity to form approaches to problems, and the GM acts as the judge to set the stakes.</p><p>Without further ado, the types of actions are:</p><p></p><h2>SNEAK</h2><p>Move with stealth and silence. Perform actions without notice. Spring an ambush.</p><p></p><p>The risk and effect of Sneak actions is usually dependent on how alert the target of the action is, and what the scale of the task is.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><p><strong>Chapter I examples</strong>: Sneak into a camp or building. Fish an item out of someone’s pocket, or plant something there. Use sleight of hand to fool someone. Spring an ambush on a single person.</p><p><strong>Chapter II examples</strong>: Sneak into a large or guarded location like a castle. Pickpocket or ambush a whole group of people.</p><p><strong>Chapter III examples</strong>: Sneak past a guarded location in broad daylight. Stealth by a monster with unusual senses. Steal something someone is actively holding while they’re looking at you.</p><p>A lower chapters, a character needs some cover or distraction to effectively do something sneaky, such as darkness or misdirection. They can probably only do it slowly. At higher chapters, they need less cover and can do it faster.</p><p>Sneaking can represent using your natural skill or magical abilities that turn you invisible or unseen to the eye.</p><p></p><h2>TRAVERSE</h2><p>Climb, swim, leap, fly. Run swiftly. Chase or flee. Pilot a vehicle or ride an animal</p><p></p><p>Traverse is usually about how far and how safely a character can move in a given amount of time. It not only includes running, jumping, climbing, etc, but also teleporting and flying, something most characters can do a little of.</p><p>Adding extra complications on to a traverse roll can change the risk and effect. For example:</p><p>I want to move:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Without touching the ground</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>…and take someone with me</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Up a vertical surface</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Through thick mud, water, heavy snow, etc Might all adjust risk and effect.</p></li></ul><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a characters’ actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Climb over a manor wall, swim a river, or cross a gap. Ride an animal or pilot a vehicle. Move a short distance quickly (a few dozen paces).</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Climb over a castle wall, swim a lake, cross a chasm. Ride a monster. Move a long distance (a field’s length) very quickly (by climbing, sprinting, jumping, teleporting, flying, etc).</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Climb a massive cliffside, swim a channel, cross a canyon. Ride a huge monster. Arrive in a nearby town almost instantly. Keep up or even outrun a horse or riding animal.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Overland travel </strong>might be a single roll, or might take a project or ritual (see the section below) to do something like teleport instantly using a ritual, book safe passage on an airship etc.</p><p></p><h2>SENSE</h2><p>Scan and assess a broad area or situation. Spot at a distance. Find tracks, clues, paths. Sense the presence of magic or hidden things</p><p></p><p>When you sense, you broadly survey or take in an area. You don’t get a lot of detail or specifics, but you might notice things like traps, hidden doors, magical constructs, hidden ambushes, people etc. You might notice smoke from a campfire, or dust kicked up from a caravan over the horizon.</p><p>Usually the risk and effect of sense actions is determined by how tense the situation is and also factors such as darkness, obscurity (from weather, dust, etc), and distance.</p><p>Sense can also be used to detect the presence of magic or people. Powerful magic might be more risky or harder to detect. Creatures or people from higher chapters might also be much harder or even impossible to detect, depending on their skill level.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Spot or detect traps, hidden doors, or hidden objects. Look for entrances into an ancient ruin. Sense an ambush. Track or hunt over ground. Detect magic or the presence of nearby mundane beings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Sense a master assassin. Track someone through new snow or in days-old mud. Detect subtle or hidden magic. Spy a moving caravan hours before it arrives. Predict the weather days in advance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Determine the exact location of an invisible creature. Track someone in a busy town by the smell of their tobacco. Visualize the ambient connections of magic around you.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>STUDY</h2><p>Analyze something or someone in detail. Discern someone’s intentions or notice deception. Perform research. Decipher an inscription</p><p></p><p>Study is looking at something with a more focused lens, in detail. You might not notice a hidden door well with study, but once you find it, you may be able to determine how to open it. Studying situations can help you untangle clues about what happened, and study can be used for research or academic pursuits, such as deciphering text,recalling ancient monster lore, or transcribing an ancient spell.</p><p>Usually it’s the qualities of what you’re studyingthat determine the risk and effect of studying something - as well as what’s going on at the time. Studying a monster for weaknesses while it’s chasing you might be a little risky for example.</p><p>You can also study living creatures to determine their emotions and intent - perhaps to see if you are being deceived. If that’s the case, their chapter usually determines</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Figure out how to open a door. Decipher a text in a foreign language. Find a path through a maze. Solve a riddle. Untangle apuzzle. Do light detective work. Determine whether the local barkeep is charging too much money.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Decipher an ancient text. Research forbidden lore. Find the weak heart scale on a wyrm. Figure out where someone has been by looking at their clothing. Determine whether the master thief is going to let you leave her den alive.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Surmise exactly what happened in a room last week from two hairs and a splotch of blood. Decipher an ancient inscription by intuition alone. Solve a mystery right away that would have stumped an entire team of local heroes. Guess the archwyrm’s riddle in one go.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>CHARM</h2><p>Sway with direct charisma, deception, or diplomacy. Call in favors. Cause distraction or misdirection</p><p></p><p>Charm can be used when you’re trying to sway with direct appeals, charisma, diplomacy, connections, or deception. Like many other actions, Charm’s effectiveness and risk is highly depending on scale and the person or group of people you are trying to Charm.</p><p>You probably won’t be able to talk your way out of every situation, but that’s something that is depending on the tone of your game. Some people just won’t listen to reason.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Sway a person into aiding you. Get the caravan owner to apologize to his daughter. Lie to a town militia person. Assume a made-up identity. Talk down a bandit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Sway a small crowd into aiding you or taking some action. Convince the king to let you out of the dungeon. Pretend to be someone well-known. Talk down an assassin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Sway an entire town of people into helping you. Convince the king to step down from his throne, then pretend to be the king for a week. Doing something that takes long term effort with Charm such as brokering peace, or a courtly romance, might be a project.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>COMMAND</h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" /></span></span>Use force of will and presence to lead or intimidate. Give orders.</p><p></p><p>Command is when you use force of will, leadership, personality, threats, or intimidation to force someone into action. It’s more blunt than Charm and may work better or worse on different kinds of people. As with charm, the scale of the target of your action, the situation, and their nature will all affect risk and effect. Scaring off a few people trying to rob you will probably be a lot easier than scaring off a hungry monster the size of a draft horse.</p><p>You can also use command to lead a group of people or run an organization.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chapter I:</strong> Effectively lead a few people into battle. Intimidate someone. Organize a defense. Force surrender from a fleeing thief. Run a small organization, such as shop or business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II:</strong> Effectively lead a platoon into battle. Intimidate a small group of people. Organize a group of peasants into a rebellion. Force an outnumbered army to retreat. Make a hardened killer hesitate. Run a large organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III:</strong> Effectively lead an army into battle. Start a revolution. Force a large number of soldiers to surrender. Run or rule a small city.</p></li></ul><p>Actions like doing battle, running a city, etc may be a project.</p><p></p><h2>TINKER</h2><p>Interact with, understand, or use alchemy, etheric constructs, or technology. Fix, pick, or break locks or mechanisms. Construct, deconstruct, or alter technology.</p><p></p><p>Tinker allows you to create, alter, or disassemble devices and constructs, whether magical or mundane.</p><p>Usually the risk and effect of a tinker action are highly dependent on the size and goal of the creation, the availability of tools, devices, workshop spaces, etc. You can often think about what ‘chapter’ a tinkering device would be from and extrapolate from there.</p><p>Tinker also allows alteration of existing devices, which could involve something like picking a lock.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><p>Create, alter, or disassemble:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Uncomplicated or relatively simple devices and constructs. A simple lock. A spell that sets off an alarm. A clockwork automata. A pair of magnification goggles. A clock. A small bomb.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Complicated magical or mundane devices and constructs. A magically sealed door. An arkentech automata. Aetherically powered lights. An airship. A power gauntlet. A spell that produces toxic gas</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Very complicated or legendary devices or constructs. A suit of arkentech power armor. An ancient arkentech golem. A forceshield. A sealed habitat.</p></li></ul><p>Many tinker actions take the form of a project or ritual.</p><p></p><h2>EXCEL</h2><p>Act with concentrated precision or skill. Fire a ranged weapon. Hit a tiny target at range. Catch a falling coin. Balance on a narrow wire. Squeeze through a tight space.</p><p></p><p>Excel is the counterpart to tinker and allows you to use your manual dexterity and agility to perform feats of skill and precision.</p><p>Excel is most often affected by the potential risks. Balancing on a wire may be hard, but not risky unless there’s a fifty foot drop underneath.</p><p>Excel can also be used to perform feats with or simply shoot ranged weaponry such as gun, bows, or bolts of energy from your staff - whatever your character has on hand.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Make a tough shot. Squeeze into a tight space. Balance on a wire. Do a backflip. Disarm someone. Cut someone’s purse strings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Shoot a coin out of someone’s hand at fifty paces. Balance on a moving wagon while juggling. Throw a knife through an arrow slit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Make a nearly impossible shot. Balance on the tip of a sword. Hit the eye of a wyrm with an arrow while it’s flying at you and you’re hanging off the side of an airship, upside down</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>SMASH</h2><p>Overwhelm with physical or magical force. Swing a melee weapon. Throw a punch or blast down a door with a magic spell. Wreck an object or obstacle</p><p></p><p>Smash is when you use violence or direct force to accomplish your goals. This could be physical strength or magical prowess. Shooting a fireball at a door or kicking it down accomplish pretty much the same thing, after all.</p><p>The risk and effect of smash are usually depending on your target and your own capabilities.</p><p>You can also use Smash to swing a melee weapon, whether that’s a giant hammer or a sword made of fire.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Break a gate. Kick a bandit in the face. Throw a punch. Blow up a door. Throw a barrel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Snap a heavy iron chain. Throw back ten people with one blow. Smash a boulder. Blow right through a stone wall.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Blow a hole through a castle wall. Use your knuckles as a battering ram to smash a castle gate. Fight a small platoon by yourself. Split a cliff face. Burn away a small forest.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>ENDURE</h2><p><br />Push yourself to your limits. Power through pain, cold, heat, or harsh environments. Lift or drag something enormously heavy.</p><p></p><p>Endure is the counterpart of smash, for when you use your ability to withstand or exert tremendous forces. It could be not just physical strength, but magical or semi-magical fortitude as well, brought on by training, spells, etc.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chapter I:</strong> Lift up a portcullis. Go for a long time without food or water. Hold your breath. Push on into extreme heat or cold. Run through the night. Win a drinking contest. Withstand pain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II:</strong> Lift an ox one handed. Eat something poisonous. Go without sleep, food, or rest for a few days. Withstand tremendous pain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III:</strong> Wade through fire or ice. Lift a three story Leggio Caravan. Carry an entire ancient tree trunk. Force open a sealed stone door. Out-drink a Jotunn.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Fortune Rolls","type":"text","_id":"0ELhIXJoeP1Tu1G8","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>When a player wants to perform a difficult task that is not necessarily dangerous, or that lacks obvious consequences, you may have them make a Fortune Roll. This is the same as a regular action roll, except the table of outcomes is different:</p><p></p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>1-3:</strong> Poor result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>4-5:</strong> Expected or average result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>6:</strong> Good result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>6,6:</strong> Excellent result or outcome</p></li></ul><p><br />Fortune rolls often change the risk and effect of future Action Rolls.</p><p></p><h2>Examples of Fortune Rolls</h2><p>The most common application of these rolls is when <strong>gathering information </strong>about a situation, or during interludes. For example, a character <strong>studies </strong>a group of monsters from a distance. The GM judges that it’s too far for there to be any danger, so the player makes a fortune roll and gets a 4, getting average information.</p><p>Researching and <strong>working on long term projects</strong> are usually all fortune rolls. Pursuing ambitions during downtime is by default a fortune roll.</p><p><strong>Tests of ability </strong>can be a fortune roll - a character can roll <strong>traverse</strong> to see how fast they show up at a scene, for example, <strong>endure </strong>to win a drinking contest, or <strong>excel </strong>to perform a coin trick to impress someone.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tests of knowledge</strong> are also usually fortune rolls. When a character wants to dredge up useful lore, history, rumor, or memory about a topic, they can recall that info by making a <strong>fortune roll </strong>using the most appropriate action they can think of. The information the GM gives them will vary depending on the action, and there may be some overlap.</p><p>A character could, for example, try to <strong>recall</strong> their familiarity with arkentech devices by making a <strong>tinker</strong> roll, remember the social etiquette of a ball with a <strong>charm</strong> roll, or try to assess the odds of survival of jumping over a lava chasm with an <strong>endure</strong> roll.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Risk and Effect","type":"text","_id":"KbtpKKCKXa8ZYRIB","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>As previously mentioned, whenever a player makes an Action Roll, the GM chooses the Risk and Effect for that roll depending on context and circumstance. The following are examples of what each level of risk/effect represents. Note that the exact meaning of each level of risk and effect will differ greatly from GM to GM; These are only one GM's interpretations, meant to give ideas and not much else.</p><p></p><h2>RISK</h2><p>Risk dictates what the consequences could be on failure or partial success. The levels of risk are:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Controlled - </strong>few or weaker consequences. For example, a character opening a door in a controller position could, on failure or partial success, still manage to open the door but take longer doing so. While this could matter in certain situations, it isn't a huge setback in most scenarios.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risky - </strong>some degree of harmful or unwanted consequences. Using the same example as before, a character attempting to open a door in a risky position could, again, still manage to open the door on failure/partial success. However, they might hear the telltale 'SNAP!' or 'CLICK!' of a trap activating as the door slides open. They would then have to react to that complication or suffer the consequences. Note that traps should have ways for players to notice them!</p></li><li><p><strong>Desperate - </strong>great or dire consequences. Slightly different example. The party runs as the dungeon collapses behind them with increasing speed. The Colossus is ahead, and seeing that the stone door in front of her is about to slide closed, she positions herself below the door and summons all her strength to keep the door from closing long enough to allow her allies to pass through. If she fails, she might be fully or partially crushed by the door, potentially taking high or even <strong>critical</strong> strain. On partial success, she may suffer intense strain but otherwise be fine. Whether her allies successfully get through despite a failure is up to each GM to decide, though whether her allies will get through on failure or not should be communicated to the Colossus's player before they roll.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>EFFECT</h2><p>Effect dictates what is expected to happen if you are successful. The levels of effect are:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>No Effect - </strong>0 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, does what it says on the tin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weak - </strong>1 clock segment is filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might successfully open one lock on a success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Normal - </strong>2 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might successfully open all locks on a success, though it may take some time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Powerful - </strong>3 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might not only open all locks on a success very quickly, but also gain an understanding of how these locks work, thus granting a boon or increased effect on future checks to open similar locks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superpowered - </strong>5 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. A character opening a door with multiple locks might open the door near-instantly and silently, allowing for an ambush on whatever lay on the other side. They could potentially also learn exactly how these locks work, allowing them to open similar locks without requiring a roll in the future.</p></li></ul><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Tempting Fate","type":"text","_id":"bmAhsBRytkFSrFkf","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>There’s one more way to get bonus dice without spending any effort or making any rolls.</p><p><strong>At any time when you roll,</strong> you can <strong>tempt fate</strong> by <strong>suggesting a negative consequence of your actions</strong>.

It is essentially your 'health' during narrative play.</p><p><strong>You might gain 1, 2, or 4 strain</strong> depending on risk when you <strong>fail or partially succeed</strong> at an action roll.<br />Rarely, when failing or partially succeeding at a Desperate action, you might take <strong>Critical Strain </strong>- resulting in an <strong>instant break. </strong>You also break if your strain <strong>reaches one or more above your maximum.</strong></p><p>Heal all strain on <strong>camp</strong> or at the end of an <strong>interlude</strong></p><p></p></div><div data-layout-content=\"true\"><h3>Resistance</h3><p>If the GM would suggest consequences other than strain for your actions, y<strong>ou can always elect to take strain instead,</strong> appropriate to the risk of the roll (1 for controlled, 2 for risky, 4 for desperate). This represents the stress of narrowly avoiding consequences for your character.</p><p>You can take more strain than you have remaining to resist something. For example, if you have only 1 strain left, you could resist something that would normally cost you 2 or 4 strain.</p><p></p><h2>EFFORT</h2></div></div><p>Effort is a resource used to <strong>Push and Aid.</strong> It is an important resource that should be managed well.</p><p>When you <strong>push yourself during your action roll</strong>, you spend 1 effort to gain +1 boon on your roll.</p><p>When you <strong>aid an ally during their action roll, </strong>you spend 1 effort to grant them +1 boon on their roll.</p><p>There is another way to lose effort. See Breaking.</p><p></p><h2>BREAKING</h2><p>As noted above, when your strain reaches one or more above your maximum or you take critical strain, you <strong>break</strong> and become too hurt or overwhelmed to continue in the current scene, and are unable to move or act on your own.</p><p>When you are <strong>broken, </strong>you must spend 1 effort to take any action. Nearby characters can also spend effort for you. Additionally, when you break, you clear all your strain boxes and take a <strong>burden. </strong>You cease to be broken at the end of the scene and may act normally from then on, though your burden remains.</p><p></p><h2>BURDENS</h2><p><strong>A burden</strong> is more <strong>long-term harm</strong> to a character and represents the mental and physical ordeal of the adventuring life. How much a burden interferes with a character is up to that character’s player. When you take a burden, write the nature of the burden underneath it. It could be a long term injury of some kind that the character ignores, scars, a change in attitude, tiredness, sickness, etc.</p><p>Then, <strong>tick two actions which have more than 0d.</strong> Those action is at at -1d until the burden is healed. Tick actions that are appropriate to the kind of burden taken.</p><p>For example:</p><p>You might tick Smash and Tinker for <strong>a broken arm.</strong></p><p>You might tick Charm and Study for <strong>tiredness.</strong></p><p>You might tick Endure and Traverse for <strong>poisoned.</strong></p><p>You might tick Command and Sense for <strong>fear.</strong></p><p>This can be done up to twice per action.</p><p>The GM can always look to burdens for possible consequences for action rolls. You can also play up your burdens to <strong>invoke</strong> them.</p><p></p><h3>Pushing through</h3><p>If a character would break for any reason, they can <strong>spend any amount of effort and roll 1d6 per effort spent</strong> to <strong>push through</strong>, choosing the highest die. On a final result of 5+, they avoid breaking and lose 1 strain, putting them 1 below maximum.</p><p></p><h3>Invoking burdens</h3><p>If a character has any burdens, they can invoke their burdens in narrative play to get into trouble when they make an action roll.</p><p><strong>Get into trouble</strong> means starting trouble or facing consequences, even on a successful roll. For example, a character with the ‘exhausted’ burden decides to get into trouble. The GM decides this character wanders off, not aware of their surroundings, while the party is traversing a monster-infested tunnel. A character with the ‘anger’ burden decides to get into trouble - the GM decides that the character acts out at an inopportune moment.</p><p>When getting into trouble or invoking a burden means changing a character’s behavior or making them act out-of-character, the GM can say broadly what happens but it can be up to the player to act it out.</p><p>Other players are free to suggest consequences for invoking burdens (including the player who invoked them), but it’s ultimately up to the GM what to choose.</p><p>If you invoked a burden at least once during a session <strong>get 1 xp</strong> at the end of that session.</p><p></p><h3>Healing burdens</h3><p>Burdens can only be healed during an interlude, during the special <strong>Heal Burdens</strong> step. Burdens are represented with a filled clock of 4, 6, or 10 segments, and characters can only heal them slowly by unticking segments during downtime. Characters can fill in any burden they like when they take one.</p><p></p><h3>3 burdens</h3><p>A character with 3 burdens can still break, clearing all strain, but doesn’t mark an extra burden. Instead of recovering and returning to themselves at the end of the scene, however, they remain broken until the expedition is over (they can still expend effort to act normally).</p><p>After the expedition is over, any character that broke this way must take their leave from adventuring for a while and <strong>cannot embark on the next expedition.</strong> They can still heal burdens during the interludes and pursue ambitions normally, then return the following expedition if they so choose.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.lgFVQllCGHZgKc3e"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664814844296,"modifiedTime":1665678203432,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"zr2iJeDGRgYVvxHH"}

For example, taking someone’s purse from them could be cutting it from their belt (with <strong>Excel</strong>) - quick but not necessarily quietly.</p><p>Alternately, it could be taking it quietly with <strong>Sneak</strong>. You could even perhaps <strong>Charm</strong> them to divert their attention while you take it off them. A heavy dungeon door could be <strong>Tinkered</strong> (if it has a lock). Alternately, it could be <strong>Smashed</strong> with a fireball, or perhaps someone could <strong>Endure</strong> lifting and holding it open for the group to pass through.</p><p>All of these different situations have different narrative outcomes and might be more risky or more or less effective depending on the situation. The key thing is that players always choose the <strong>approach and the action they want to use</strong>. The GM is free to suggest actions, and also to decide <strong>whether an action is more or less risky or effective</strong>. This is where the meat of narrative play in ICON lies. Players can use their creativity to form approaches to problems, and the GM acts as the judge to set the stakes.</p><p>Without further ado, the types of actions are:</p><p></p><h2>SNEAK</h2><p>Move with stealth and silence. Perform actions without notice. Spring an ambush.</p><p></p><p>The risk and effect of Sneak actions is usually dependent on how alert the target of the action is, and what the scale of the task is.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><p><strong>Chapter I examples</strong>: Sneak into a camp or building. Fish an item out of someone’s pocket, or plant something there. Use sleight of hand to fool someone. Spring an ambush on a single person.</p><p><strong>Chapter II examples</strong>: Sneak into a large or guarded location like a castle. Pickpocket or ambush a whole group of people.</p><p><strong>Chapter III examples</strong>: Sneak past a guarded location in broad daylight. Stealth by a monster with unusual senses. Steal something someone is actively holding while they’re looking at you.</p><p>A lower chapters, a character needs some cover or distraction to effectively do something sneaky, such as darkness or misdirection. They can probably only do it slowly. At higher chapters, they need less cover and can do it faster.</p><p>Sneaking can represent using your natural skill or magical abilities that turn you invisible or unseen to the eye.</p><p></p><h2>TRAVERSE</h2><p>Climb, swim, leap, fly. Run swiftly. Chase or flee. Pilot a vehicle or ride an animal</p><p></p><p>Traverse is usually about how far and how safely a character can move in a given amount of time. It not only includes running, jumping, climbing, etc, but also teleporting and flying, something most characters can do a little of.</p><p>Adding extra complications on to a traverse roll can change the risk and effect. For example:</p><p>I want to move:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Without touching the ground</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>…and take someone with me</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Up a vertical surface</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Through thick mud, water, heavy snow, etc Might all adjust risk and effect.</p></li></ul><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a characters’ actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Climb over a manor wall, swim a river, or cross a gap. Ride an animal or pilot a vehicle. Move a short distance quickly (a few dozen paces).</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Climb over a castle wall, swim a lake, cross a chasm. Ride a monster. Move a long distance (a field’s length) very quickly (by climbing, sprinting, jumping, teleporting, flying, etc).</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Climb a massive cliffside, swim a channel, cross a canyon. Ride a huge monster. Arrive in a nearby town almost instantly. Keep up or even outrun a horse or riding animal.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Overland travel </strong>might be a single roll, or might take a project or ritual (see the section below) to do something like teleport instantly using a ritual, book safe passage on an airship etc.</p><p></p><h2>SENSE</h2><p>Scan and assess a broad area or situation. Spot at a distance. Find tracks, clues, paths. Sense the presence of magic or hidden things</p><p></p><p>When you sense, you broadly survey or take in an area. You don’t get a lot of detail or specifics, but you might notice things like traps, hidden doors, magical constructs, hidden ambushes, people etc. You might notice smoke from a campfire, or dust kicked up from a caravan over the horizon.</p><p>Usually the risk and effect of sense actions is determined by how tense the situation is and also factors such as darkness, obscurity (from weather, dust, etc), and distance.</p><p>Sense can also be used to detect the presence of magic or people. Powerful magic might be more risky or harder to detect. Creatures or people from higher chapters might also be much harder or even impossible to detect, depending on their skill level.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Spot or detect traps, hidden doors, or hidden objects. Look for entrances into an ancient ruin. Sense an ambush. Track or hunt over ground. Detect magic or the presence of nearby mundane beings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Sense a master assassin. Track someone through new snow or in days-old mud. Detect subtle or hidden magic. Spy a moving caravan hours before it arrives. Predict the weather days in advance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Determine the exact location of an invisible creature. Track someone in a busy town by the smell of their tobacco. Visualize the ambient connections of magic around you.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>STUDY</h2><p>Analyze something or someone in detail. Discern someone’s intentions or notice deception. Perform research. Decipher an inscription</p><p></p><p>Study is looking at something with a more focused lens, in detail. You might not notice a hidden door well with study, but once you find it, you may be able to determine how to open it. Studying situations can help you untangle clues about what happened, and study can be used for research or academic pursuits, such as deciphering text,recalling ancient monster lore, or transcribing an ancient spell.</p><p>Usually it’s the qualities of what you’re studyingthat determine the risk and effect of studying something - as well as what’s going on at the time. Studying a monster for weaknesses while it’s chasing you might be a little risky for example.</p><p>You can also study living creatures to determine their emotions and intent - perhaps to see if you are being deceived. If that’s the case, their chapter usually determines</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Figure out how to open a door. Decipher a text in a foreign language. Find a path through a maze. Solve a riddle. Untangle apuzzle. Do light detective work. Determine whether the local barkeep is charging too much money.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Decipher an ancient text. Research forbidden lore. Find the weak heart scale on a wyrm. Figure out where someone has been by looking at their clothing. Determine whether the master thief is going to let you leave her den alive.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Surmise exactly what happened in a room last week from two hairs and a splotch of blood. Decipher an ancient inscription by intuition alone. Solve a mystery right away that would have stumped an entire team of local heroes. Guess the archwyrm’s riddle in one go.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>CHARM</h2><p>Sway with direct charisma, deception, or diplomacy. Call in favors. Cause distraction or misdirection</p><p></p><p>Charm can be used when you’re trying to sway with direct appeals, charisma, diplomacy, connections, or deception. Like many other actions, Charm’s effectiveness and risk is highly depending on scale and the person or group of people you are trying to Charm.</p><p>You probably won’t be able to talk your way out of every situation, but that’s something that is depending on the tone of your game. Some people just won’t listen to reason.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Sway a person into aiding you. Get the caravan owner to apologize to his daughter. Lie to a town militia person. Assume a made-up identity. Talk down a bandit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Sway a small crowd into aiding you or taking some action. Convince the king to let you out of the dungeon. Pretend to be someone well-known. Talk down an assassin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Sway an entire town of people into helping you. Convince the king to step down from his throne, then pretend to be the king for a week. Doing something that takes long term effort with Charm such as brokering peace, or a courtly romance, might be a project.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>COMMAND</h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" /></span></span>Use force of will and presence to lead or intimidate. Give orders.</p><p></p><p>Command is when you use force of will, leadership, personality, threats, or intimidation to force someone into action. It’s more blunt than Charm and may work better or worse on different kinds of people. As with charm, the scale of the target of your action, the situation, and their nature will all affect risk and effect. Scaring off a few people trying to rob you will probably be a lot easier than scaring off a hungry monster the size of a draft horse.</p><p>You can also use command to lead a group of people or run an organization.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chapter I:</strong> Effectively lead a few people into battle. Intimidate someone. Organize a defense. Force surrender from a fleeing thief. Run a small organization, such as shop or business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II:</strong> Effectively lead a platoon into battle. Intimidate a small group of people. Organize a group of peasants into a rebellion. Force an outnumbered army to retreat. Make a hardened killer hesitate. Run a large organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III:</strong> Effectively lead an army into battle. Start a revolution. Force a large number of soldiers to surrender. Run or rule a small city.</p></li></ul><p>Actions like doing battle, running a city, etc may be a project.</p><p></p><h2>TINKER</h2><p>Interact with, understand, or use alchemy, etheric constructs, or technology. Fix, pick, or break locks or mechanisms. Construct, deconstruct, or alter technology.</p><p></p><p>Tinker allows you to create, alter, or disassemble devices and constructs, whether magical or mundane.</p><p>Usually the risk and effect of a tinker action are highly dependent on the size and goal of the creation, the availability of tools, devices, workshop spaces, etc. You can often think about what ‘chapter’ a tinkering device would be from and extrapolate from there.</p><p>Tinker also allows alteration of existing devices, which could involve something like picking a lock.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><p>Create, alter, or disassemble:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Uncomplicated or relatively simple devices and constructs. A simple lock. A spell that sets off an alarm. A clockwork automata. A pair of magnification goggles. A clock. A small bomb.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Complicated magical or mundane devices and constructs. A magically sealed door. An arkentech automata. Aetherically powered lights. An airship. A power gauntlet. A spell that produces toxic gas</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Very complicated or legendary devices or constructs. A suit of arkentech power armor. An ancient arkentech golem. A forceshield. A sealed habitat.</p></li></ul><p>Many tinker actions take the form of a project or ritual.</p><p></p><h2>EXCEL</h2><p>Act with concentrated precision or skill. Fire a ranged weapon. Hit a tiny target at range. Catch a falling coin. Balance on a narrow wire. Squeeze through a tight space.</p><p></p><p>Excel is the counterpart to tinker and allows you to use your manual dexterity and agility to perform feats of skill and precision.</p><p>Excel is most often affected by the potential risks. Balancing on a wire may be hard, but not risky unless there’s a fifty foot drop underneath.</p><p>Excel can also be used to perform feats with or simply shoot ranged weaponry such as gun, bows, or bolts of energy from your staff - whatever your character has on hand.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Make a tough shot. Squeeze into a tight space. Balance on a wire. Do a backflip. Disarm someone. Cut someone’s purse strings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Shoot a coin out of someone’s hand at fifty paces. Balance on a moving wagon while juggling. Throw a knife through an arrow slit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Make a nearly impossible shot. Balance on the tip of a sword. Hit the eye of a wyrm with an arrow while it’s flying at you and you’re hanging off the side of an airship, upside down</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>SMASH</h2><p>Overwhelm with physical or magical force. Swing a melee weapon. Throw a punch or blast down a door with a magic spell. Wreck an object or obstacle</p><p></p><p>Smash is when you use violence or direct force to accomplish your goals. This could be physical strength or magical prowess. Shooting a fireball at a door or kicking it down accomplish pretty much the same thing, after all.</p><p>The risk and effect of smash are usually depending on your target and your own capabilities.</p><p>You can also use Smash to swing a melee weapon, whether that’s a giant hammer or a sword made of fire.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Break a gate. Kick a bandit in the face. Throw a punch. Blow up a door. Throw a barrel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Snap a heavy iron chain. Throw back ten people with one blow. Smash a boulder. Blow right through a stone wall.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Blow a hole through a castle wall. Use your knuckles as a battering ram to smash a castle gate. Fight a small platoon by yourself. Split a cliff face. Burn away a small forest.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>ENDURE</h2><p><br />Push yourself to your limits. Power through pain, cold, heat, or harsh environments. Lift or drag something enormously heavy.</p><p></p><p>Endure is the counterpart of smash, for when you use your ability to withstand or exert tremendous forces. It could be not just physical strength, but magical or semi-magical fortitude as well, brought on by training, spells, etc.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chapter I:</strong> Lift up a portcullis. Go for a long time without food or water. Hold your breath. Push on into extreme heat or cold. Run through the night. Win a drinking contest. Withstand pain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II:</strong> Lift an ox one handed. Eat something poisonous. Go without sleep, food, or rest for a few days. Withstand tremendous pain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III:</strong> Wade through fire or ice. Lift a three story Leggio Caravan. Carry an entire ancient tree trunk. Force open a sealed stone door. Out-drink a Jotunn.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Fortune Rolls","type":"text","_id":"0ELhIXJoeP1Tu1G8","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>When a player wants to perform a difficult task that is not necessarily dangerous, or that lacks obvious consequences, you may have them make a Fortune Roll. This is the same as a regular action roll, except the table of outcomes is different:</p><p></p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>1-3:</strong> Poor result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>4-5:</strong> Expected or average result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>6:</strong> Good result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>6,6:</strong> Excellent result or outcome</p></li></ul><p><br />Fortune rolls often change the risk and effect of future Action Rolls.</p><p></p><h2>Examples of Fortune Rolls</h2><p>The most common application of these rolls is when <strong>gathering information </strong>about a situation, or during interludes. For example, a character <strong>studies </strong>a group of monsters from a distance. The GM judges that it’s too far for there to be any danger, so the player makes a fortune roll and gets a 4, getting average information.</p><p>Researching and <strong>working on long term projects</strong> are usually all fortune rolls. Pursuing ambitions during downtime is by default a fortune roll.</p><p><strong>Tests of ability </strong>can be a fortune roll - a character can roll <strong>traverse</strong> to see how fast they show up at a scene, for example, <strong>endure </strong>to win a drinking contest, or <strong>excel </strong>to perform a coin trick to impress someone.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tests of knowledge</strong> are also usually fortune rolls. When a character wants to dredge up useful lore, history, rumor, or memory about a topic, they can recall that info by making a <strong>fortune roll </strong>using the most appropriate action they can think of. The information the GM gives them will vary depending on the action, and there may be some overlap.</p><p>A character could, for example, try to <strong>recall</strong> their familiarity with arkentech devices by making a <strong>tinker</strong> roll, remember the social etiquette of a ball with a <strong>charm</strong> roll, or try to assess the odds of survival of jumping over a lava chasm with an <strong>endure</strong> roll.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Risk and Effect","type":"text","_id":"KbtpKKCKXa8ZYRIB","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>As previously mentioned, whenever a player makes an Action Roll, the GM chooses the Risk and Effect for that roll depending on context and circumstance. The following are examples of what each level of risk/effect represents. Note that the exact meaning of each level of risk and effect will differ greatly from GM to GM; These are only one GM's interpretations, meant to give ideas and not much else.</p><p></p><h2>RISK</h2><p>Risk dictates what the consequences could be on failure or partial success. The levels of risk are:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Controlled - </strong>few or weaker consequences. For example, a character opening a door in a controller position could, on failure or partial success, still manage to open the door but take longer doing so. While this could matter in certain situations, it isn't a huge setback in most scenarios.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risky - </strong>some degree of harmful or unwanted consequences. Using the same example as before, a character attempting to open a door in a risky position could, again, still manage to open the door on failure/partial success. However, they might hear the telltale 'SNAP!' or 'CLICK!' of a trap activating as the door slides open. They would then have to react to that complication or suffer the consequences. Note that traps should have ways for players to notice them!</p></li><li><p><strong>Desperate - </strong>great or dire consequences. Slightly different example. The party runs as the dungeon collapses behind them with increasing speed. The Colossus is ahead, and seeing that the stone door in front of her is about to slide closed, she positions herself below the door and summons all her strength to keep the door from closing long enough to allow her allies to pass through. If she fails, she might be fully or partially crushed by the door, potentially taking high or even <strong>critical</strong> strain. On partial success, she may suffer intense strain but otherwise be fine. Whether her allies successfully get through despite a failure is up to each GM to decide, though whether her allies will get through on failure or not should be communicated to the Colossus's player before they roll.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>EFFECT</h2><p>Effect dictates what is expected to happen if you are successful. The levels of effect are:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>No Effect - </strong>0 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, does what it says on the tin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weak - </strong>1 clock segment is filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might successfully open one lock on a success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Normal - </strong>2 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might successfully open all locks on a success, though it may take some time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Powerful - </strong>3 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might not only open all locks on a success very quickly, but also gain an understanding of how these locks work, thus granting a boon or increased effect on future checks to open similar locks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superpowered - </strong>5 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. A character opening a door with multiple locks might open the door near-instantly and silently, allowing for an ambush on whatever lay on the other side. They could potentially also learn exactly how these locks work, allowing them to open similar locks without requiring a roll in the future.</p></li></ul><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Tempting Fate","type":"text","_id":"bmAhsBRytkFSrFkf","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>There’s one more way to get bonus dice without spending any effort or making any rolls.</p><p><strong>At any time when you roll,</strong> you can <strong>tempt fate</strong> by <strong>suggesting a negative consequence of your actions</strong>.

It is essentially your 'health' during narrative play.</p><p><strong>You might gain 1, 2, or 4 strain</strong> depending on risk when you <strong>fail or partially succeed</strong> at an action roll.<br />Rarely, when failing or partially succeeding at a Desperate action, you might take <strong>Critical Strain </strong>- resulting in an <strong>instant break. </strong>You also break if your strain <strong>reaches one or more above your maximum.</strong></p><p>Heal all strain on <strong>camp</strong> or at the end of an <strong>interlude</strong></p><p></p></div><div data-layout-content=\"true\"><h3>Resistance</h3><p>If the GM would suggest consequences other than strain for your actions, y<strong>ou can always elect to take strain instead,</strong> appropriate to the risk of the roll (1 for controlled, 2 for risky, 4 for desperate). This represents the stress of narrowly avoiding consequences for your character.</p><p>You can take more strain than you have remaining to resist something. For example, if you have only 1 strain left, you could resist something that would normally cost you 2 or 4 strain.</p><p></p><h2>EFFORT</h2></div></div><p>Effort is a resource used to <strong>Push and Aid.</strong> It is an important resource that should be managed well.</p><p>When you <strong>push yourself during your action roll</strong>, you spend 1 effort to gain +1 boon on your roll.</p><p>When you <strong>aid an ally during their action roll, </strong>you spend 1 effort to grant them +1 boon on their roll.</p><p>There is another way to lose effort. See Breaking.</p><p></p><h2>BREAKING</h2><p>As noted above, when your strain reaches one or more above your maximum or you take critical strain, you <strong>break</strong> and become too hurt or overwhelmed to continue in the current scene, and are unable to move or act on your own.</p><p>When you are <strong>broken, </strong>you must spend 1 effort to take any action. Nearby characters can also spend effort for you. Additionally, when you break, you clear all your strain boxes and take a <strong>burden. </strong>You cease to be broken at the end of the scene and may act normally from then on, though your burden remains.</p><p></p><h2>BURDENS</h2><p><strong>A burden</strong> is more <strong>long-term harm</strong> to a character and represents the mental and physical ordeal of the adventuring life. How much a burden interferes with a character is up to that character’s player. When you take a burden, write the nature of the burden underneath it. It could be a long term injury of some kind that the character ignores, scars, a change in attitude, tiredness, sickness, etc.</p><p>Then, <strong>tick two actions which have more than 0d.</strong> Those action is at at -1d until the burden is healed. Tick actions that are appropriate to the kind of burden taken.</p><p>For example:</p><p>You might tick Smash and Tinker for <strong>a broken arm.</strong></p><p>You might tick Charm and Study for <strong>tiredness.</strong></p><p>You might tick Endure and Traverse for <strong>poisoned.</strong></p><p>You might tick Command and Sense for <strong>fear.</strong></p><p>This can be done up to twice per action.</p><p>The GM can always look to burdens for possible consequences for action rolls. You can also play up your burdens to <strong>invoke</strong> them.</p><p></p><h3>Invoking burdens</h3><p>If a character has any burdens, they can invoke their burdens in narrative play to get into trouble when they make an action roll.</p><p><strong>Get into trouble</strong> means starting trouble or facing consequences, even on a successful roll. For example, a character with the ‘exhausted’ burden decides to get into trouble. The GM decides this character wanders off, not aware of their surroundings, while the party is traversing a monster-infested tunnel. A character with the ‘anger’ burden decides to get into trouble - the GM decides that the character acts out at an inopportune moment.</p><p>When getting into trouble or invoking a burden means changing a character’s behavior or making them act out-of-character, the GM can say broadly what happens but it can be up to the player to act it out.</p><p>Other players are free to suggest consequences for invoking burdens (including the player who invoked them), but it’s ultimately up to the GM what to choose.</p><p>If you invoked a burden at least once during a session <strong>get 1 xp</strong> at the end of that session.</p><p></p><h3>Healing burdens</h3><p>Burdens can only be healed during an interlude, during the special <strong>Heal Burdens</strong> step. Burdens are represented with a filled clock of 4, 6, or 10 segments, and characters can only heal them slowly by unticking segments during downtime. Characters can fill in any burden they like when they take one.</p><p></p><h3>3 burdens</h3><p>A character with 3 burdens can still break, clearing all strain, but doesn’t mark an extra burden. Instead of recovering and returning to themselves at the end of the scene, however, they remain broken until the expedition is over (they can still expend effort to act normally).</p><p>After the expedition is over, any character that broke this way must take their leave from adventuring for a while and <strong>cannot embark on the next expedition.</strong> They can still heal burdens during the interludes and pursue ambitions normally, then return the following expedition if they so choose.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.lgFVQllCGHZgKc3e"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664814844296,"modifiedTime":1686412396432,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"zr2iJeDGRgYVvxHH"}

For example, taking someone’s purse from them could be cutting it from their belt (with <strong>Excel</strong>) - quick but not necessarily quietly.</p><p>Alternately, it could be taking it quietly with <strong>Sneak</strong>. You could even perhaps <strong>Charm</strong> them to divert their attention while you take it off them. A heavy dungeon door could be <strong>Tinkered</strong> (if it has a lock). Alternately, it could be <strong>Smashed</strong> with a fireball, or perhaps someone could <strong>Endure</strong> lifting and holding it open for the group to pass through.</p><p>All of these different situations have different narrative outcomes and might be more risky or more or less effective depending on the situation. The key thing is that players always choose the <strong>approach and the action they want to use</strong>. The GM is free to suggest actions, and also to decide <strong>whether an action is more or less risky or effective</strong>. This is where the meat of narrative play in ICON lies. Players can use their creativity to form approaches to problems, and the GM acts as the judge to set the stakes.</p><p>Without further ado, the types of actions are:</p><p></p><h2>SNEAK</h2><p>Move with stealth and silence. Perform actions without notice. Spring an ambush.</p><p></p><p>The risk and effect of Sneak actions is usually dependent on how alert the target of the action is, and what the scale of the task is.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><p><strong>Chapter I examples</strong>: Sneak into a camp or building. Fish an item out of someone’s pocket, or plant something there. Use sleight of hand to fool someone. Spring an ambush on a single person.</p><p><strong>Chapter II examples</strong>: Sneak into a large or guarded location like a castle. Pickpocket or ambush a whole group of people.</p><p><strong>Chapter III examples</strong>: Sneak past a guarded location in broad daylight. Stealth by a monster with unusual senses. Steal something someone is actively holding while they’re looking at you.</p><p>A lower chapters, a character needs some cover or distraction to effectively do something sneaky, such as darkness or misdirection. They can probably only do it slowly. At higher chapters, they need less cover and can do it faster.</p><p>Sneaking can represent using your natural skill or magical abilities that turn you invisible or unseen to the eye.</p><p></p><h2>TRAVERSE</h2><p>Climb, swim, leap, fly. Run swiftly. Chase or flee. Pilot a vehicle or ride an animal</p><p></p><p>Traverse is usually about how far and how safely a character can move in a given amount of time. It not only includes running, jumping, climbing, etc, but also teleporting and flying, something most characters can do a little of.</p><p>Adding extra complications on to a traverse roll can change the risk and effect. For example:</p><p>I want to move:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Without touching the ground</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>…and take someone with me</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Up a vertical surface</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>Through thick mud, water, heavy snow, etc Might all adjust risk and effect.</p></li></ul><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a characters’ actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Climb over a manor wall, swim a river, or cross a gap. Ride an animal or pilot a vehicle. Move a short distance quickly (a few dozen paces).</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Climb over a castle wall, swim a lake, cross a chasm. Ride a monster. Move a long distance (a field’s length) very quickly (by climbing, sprinting, jumping, teleporting, flying, etc).</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Climb a massive cliffside, swim a channel, cross a canyon. Ride a huge monster. Arrive in a nearby town almost instantly. Keep up or even outrun a horse or riding animal.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Overland travel </strong>might be a single roll, or might take a project or ritual (see the section below) to do something like teleport instantly using a ritual, book safe passage on an airship etc.</p><p></p><h2>SENSE</h2><p>Scan and assess a broad area or situation. Spot at a distance. Find tracks, clues, paths. Sense the presence of magic or hidden things</p><p></p><p>When you sense, you broadly survey or take in an area. You don’t get a lot of detail or specifics, but you might notice things like traps, hidden doors, magical constructs, hidden ambushes, people etc. You might notice smoke from a campfire, or dust kicked up from a caravan over the horizon.</p><p>Usually the risk and effect of sense actions is determined by how tense the situation is and also factors such as darkness, obscurity (from weather, dust, etc), and distance.</p><p>Sense can also be used to detect the presence of magic or people. Powerful magic might be more risky or harder to detect. Creatures or people from higher chapters might also be much harder or even impossible to detect, depending on their skill level.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Spot or detect traps, hidden doors, or hidden objects. Look for entrances into an ancient ruin. Sense an ambush. Track or hunt over ground. Detect magic or the presence of nearby mundane beings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Sense a master assassin. Track someone through new snow or in days-old mud. Detect subtle or hidden magic. Spy a moving caravan hours before it arrives. Predict the weather days in advance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Determine the exact location of an invisible creature. Track someone in a busy town by the smell of their tobacco. Visualize the ambient connections of magic around you.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>STUDY</h2><p>Analyze something or someone in detail. Discern someone’s intentions or notice deception. Perform research. Decipher an inscription</p><p></p><p>Study is looking at something with a more focused lens, in detail. You might not notice a hidden door well with study, but once you find it, you may be able to determine how to open it. Studying situations can help you untangle clues about what happened, and study can be used for research or academic pursuits, such as deciphering text,recalling ancient monster lore, or transcribing an ancient spell.</p><p>Usually it’s the qualities of what you’re studyingthat determine the risk and effect of studying something - as well as what’s going on at the time. Studying a monster for weaknesses while it’s chasing you might be a little risky for example.</p><p>You can also study living creatures to determine their emotions and intent - perhaps to see if you are being deceived. If that’s the case, their chapter usually determines</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Figure out how to open a door. Decipher a text in a foreign language. Find a path through a maze. Solve a riddle. Untangle apuzzle. Do light detective work. Determine whether the local barkeep is charging too much money.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Decipher an ancient text. Research forbidden lore. Find the weak heart scale on a wyrm. Figure out where someone has been by looking at their clothing. Determine whether the master thief is going to let you leave her den alive.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Surmise exactly what happened in a room last week from two hairs and a splotch of blood. Decipher an ancient inscription by intuition alone. Solve a mystery right away that would have stumped an entire team of local heroes. Guess the archwyrm’s riddle in one go.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>CHARM</h2><p>Sway with direct charisma, deception, or diplomacy. Call in favors. Cause distraction or misdirection</p><p></p><p>Charm can be used when you’re trying to sway with direct appeals, charisma, diplomacy, connections, or deception. Like many other actions, Charm’s effectiveness and risk is highly depending on scale and the person or group of people you are trying to Charm.</p><p>You probably won’t be able to talk your way out of every situation, but that’s something that is depending on the tone of your game. Some people just won’t listen to reason.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Sway a person into aiding you. Get the caravan owner to apologize to his daughter. Lie to a town militia person. Assume a made-up identity. Talk down a bandit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Sway a small crowd into aiding you or taking some action. Convince the king to let you out of the dungeon. Pretend to be someone well-known. Talk down an assassin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Sway an entire town of people into helping you. Convince the king to step down from his throne, then pretend to be the king for a week. Doing something that takes long term effort with Charm such as brokering peace, or a courtly romance, might be a project.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>COMMAND</h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" /></span></span>Use force of will and presence to lead or intimidate. Give orders.</p><p></p><p>Command is when you use force of will, leadership, personality, threats, or intimidation to force someone into action. It’s more blunt than Charm and may work better or worse on different kinds of people. As with charm, the scale of the target of your action, the situation, and their nature will all affect risk and effect. Scaring off a few people trying to rob you will probably be a lot easier than scaring off a hungry monster the size of a draft horse.</p><p>You can also use command to lead a group of people or run an organization.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chapter I:</strong> Effectively lead a few people into battle. Intimidate someone. Organize a defense. Force surrender from a fleeing thief. Run a small organization, such as shop or business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II:</strong> Effectively lead a platoon into battle. Intimidate a small group of people. Organize a group of peasants into a rebellion. Force an outnumbered army to retreat. Make a hardened killer hesitate. Run a large organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III:</strong> Effectively lead an army into battle. Start a revolution. Force a large number of soldiers to surrender. Run or rule a small city.</p></li></ul><p>Actions like doing battle, running a city, etc may be a project.</p><p></p><h2>TINKER</h2><p>Interact with, understand, or use alchemy, etheric constructs, or technology. Fix, pick, or break locks or mechanisms. Construct, deconstruct, or alter technology.</p><p></p><p>Tinker allows you to create, alter, or disassemble devices and constructs, whether magical or mundane.</p><p>Usually the risk and effect of a tinker action are highly dependent on the size and goal of the creation, the availability of tools, devices, workshop spaces, etc. You can often think about what ‘chapter’ a tinkering device would be from and extrapolate from there.</p><p>Tinker also allows alteration of existing devices, which could involve something like picking a lock.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><p>Create, alter, or disassemble:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Uncomplicated or relatively simple devices and constructs. A simple lock. A spell that sets off an alarm. A clockwork automata. A pair of magnification goggles. A clock. A small bomb.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Complicated magical or mundane devices and constructs. A magically sealed door. An arkentech automata. Aetherically powered lights. An airship. A power gauntlet. A spell that produces toxic gas</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Very complicated or legendary devices or constructs. A suit of arkentech power armor. An ancient arkentech golem. A forceshield. A sealed habitat.</p></li></ul><p>Many tinker actions take the form of a project or ritual.</p><p></p><h2>EXCEL</h2><p>Act with concentrated precision or skill. Fire a ranged weapon. Hit a tiny target at range. Catch a falling coin. Balance on a narrow wire. Squeeze through a tight space.</p><p></p><p>Excel is the counterpart to tinker and allows you to use your manual dexterity and agility to perform feats of skill and precision.</p><p>Excel is most often affected by the potential risks. Balancing on a wire may be hard, but not risky unless there’s a fifty foot drop underneath.</p><p>Excel can also be used to perform feats with or simply shoot ranged weaponry such as gun, bows, or bolts of energy from your staff - whatever your character has on hand.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Make a tough shot. Squeeze into a tight space. Balance on a wire. Do a backflip. Disarm someone. Cut someone’s purse strings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Shoot a coin out of someone’s hand at fifty paces. Balance on a moving wagon while juggling. Throw a knife through an arrow slit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Make a nearly impossible shot. Balance on the tip of a sword. Hit the eye of a wyrm with an arrow while it’s flying at you and you’re hanging off the side of an airship, upside down</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>SMASH</h2><p>Overwhelm with physical or magical force. Swing a melee weapon. Throw a punch or blast down a door with a magic spell. Wreck an object or obstacle</p><p></p><p>Smash is when you use violence or direct force to accomplish your goals. This could be physical strength or magical prowess. Shooting a fireball at a door or kicking it down accomplish pretty much the same thing, after all.</p><p>The risk and effect of smash are usually depending on your target and your own capabilities.</p><p>You can also use Smash to swing a melee weapon, whether that’s a giant hammer or a sword made of fire.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Break a gate. Kick a bandit in the face. Throw a punch. Blow up a door. Throw a barrel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Snap a heavy iron chain. Throw back ten people with one blow. Smash a boulder. Blow right through a stone wall.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Blow a hole through a castle wall. Use your knuckles as a battering ram to smash a castle gate. Fight a small platoon by yourself. Split a cliff face. Burn away a small forest.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>ENDURE</h2><p><br />Push yourself to your limits. Power through pain, cold, heat, or harsh environments. Lift or drag something enormously heavy.</p><p></p><p>Endure is the counterpart of smash, for when you use your ability to withstand or exert tremendous forces. It could be not just physical strength, but magical or semi-magical fortitude as well, brought on by training, spells, etc.</p><p>Here are the rough capabilities of a character’s actions, depending on chapter:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chapter I:</strong> Lift up a portcullis. Go for a long time without food or water. Hold your breath. Push on into extreme heat or cold. Run through the night. Win a drinking contest. Withstand pain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter II:</strong> Lift an ox one handed. Eat something poisonous. Go without sleep, food, or rest for a few days. Withstand tremendous pain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter III:</strong> Wade through fire or ice. Lift a three story Leggio Caravan. Carry an entire ancient tree trunk. Force open a sealed stone door. Out-drink a Jotunn.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Fortune Rolls","type":"text","_id":"0ELhIXJoeP1Tu1G8","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>When a player wants to perform a difficult task that is not necessarily dangerous, or that lacks obvious consequences, you may have them make a Fortune Roll. This is the same as a regular action roll, except the table of outcomes is different:</p><p></p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>1-3:</strong> Poor result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>4-5:</strong> Expected or average result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>6:</strong> Good result or outcome</p></li><li><p><strong>6,6:</strong> Excellent result or outcome</p></li></ul><p><br />Fortune rolls often change the risk and effect of future Action Rolls.</p><p></p><h2>Examples of Fortune Rolls</h2><p>The most common application of these rolls is when <strong>gathering information </strong>about a situation, or during interludes. For example, a character <strong>studies </strong>a group of monsters from a distance. The GM judges that it’s too far for there to be any danger, so the player makes a fortune roll and gets a 4, getting average information.</p><p>Researching and <strong>working on long term projects</strong> are usually all fortune rolls. Pursuing ambitions during downtime is by default a fortune roll.</p><p><strong>Tests of ability </strong>can be a fortune roll - a character can roll <strong>traverse</strong> to see how fast they show up at a scene, for example, <strong>endure </strong>to win a drinking contest, or <strong>excel </strong>to perform a coin trick to impress someone.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tests of knowledge</strong> are also usually fortune rolls. When a character wants to dredge up useful lore, history, rumor, or memory about a topic, they can recall that info by making a <strong>fortune roll </strong>using the most appropriate action they can think of. The information the GM gives them will vary depending on the action, and there may be some overlap.</p><p>A character could, for example, try to <strong>recall</strong> their familiarity with arkentech devices by making a <strong>tinker</strong> roll, remember the social etiquette of a ball with a <strong>charm</strong> roll, or try to assess the odds of survival of jumping over a lava chasm with an <strong>endure</strong> roll.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Risk and Effect","type":"text","_id":"KbtpKKCKXa8ZYRIB","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>As previously mentioned, whenever a player makes an Action Roll, the GM chooses the Risk and Effect for that roll depending on context and circumstance. The following are examples of what each level of risk/effect represents. Note that the exact meaning of each level of risk and effect will differ greatly from GM to GM; These are only one GM's interpretations, meant to give ideas and not much else.</p><p></p><h2>RISK</h2><p>Risk dictates what the consequences could be on failure or partial success. The levels of risk are:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Controlled - </strong>few or weaker consequences. For example, a character opening a door in a controller position could, on failure or partial success, still manage to open the door but take longer doing so. While this could matter in certain situations, it isn't a huge setback in most scenarios.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risky - </strong>some degree of harmful or unwanted consequences. Using the same example as before, a character attempting to open a door in a risky position could, again, still manage to open the door on failure/partial success. However, they might hear the telltale 'SNAP!' or 'CLICK!' of a trap activating as the door slides open. They would then have to react to that complication or suffer the consequences. Note that traps should have ways for players to notice them!</p></li><li><p><strong>Desperate - </strong>great or dire consequences. Slightly different example. The party runs as the dungeon collapses behind them with increasing speed. The Colossus is ahead, and seeing that the stone door in front of her is about to slide closed, she positions herself below the door and summons all her strength to keep the door from closing long enough to allow her allies to pass through. If she fails, she might be fully or partially crushed by the door, potentially taking high or even <strong>critical</strong> strain. On partial success, she may suffer intense strain but otherwise be fine. Whether her allies successfully get through despite a failure is up to each GM to decide, though whether her allies will get through on failure or not should be communicated to the Colossus's player before they roll.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>EFFECT</h2><p>Effect dictates what is expected to happen if you are successful. The levels of effect are:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>No Effect - </strong>0 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, does what it says on the tin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weak - </strong>1 clock segment is filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might successfully open one lock on a success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Normal - </strong>2 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might successfully open all locks on a success, though it may take some time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Powerful - </strong>3 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. Otherwise, a character opening a door with multiple locks might not only open all locks on a success very quickly, but also gain an understanding of how these locks work, thus granting a boon or increased effect on future checks to open similar locks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superpowered - </strong>5 clock segments are filled in if attempting to progress a clock. A character opening a door with multiple locks might open the door near-instantly and silently, allowing for an ambush on whatever lay on the other side. They could potentially also learn exactly how these locks work, allowing them to open similar locks without requiring a roll in the future.</p></li></ul><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Tempting Fate","type":"text","_id":"bmAhsBRytkFSrFkf","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>There’s one more way to get bonus dice without spending any effort or making any rolls.</p><p><strong>At any time when you roll,</strong> you can <strong>tempt fate</strong> by <strong>suggesting a negative consequence of your actions</strong>.

It is essentially your 'health' during narrative play.</p><p><strong>You might gain 1, 2, or 4 strain</strong> depending on risk when you <strong>fail or partially succeed</strong> at an action roll.<br />Rarely, when failing or partially succeeding at a Desperate action, you might take <strong>Critical Strain </strong>- resulting in an <strong>instant break. </strong>You also break if your strain <strong>reaches one or more above your maximum.</strong></p><p>Heal all strain on <strong>camp</strong> or at the end of an <strong>interlude</strong></p><p></p></div><div data-layout-content=\"true\"><h3>Resistance</h3><p>If the GM would suggest consequences other than strain for your actions, y<strong>ou can always elect to take strain instead,</strong> appropriate to the risk of the roll (1 for controlled, 2 for risky, 4 for desperate). This represents the stress of narrowly avoiding consequences for your character.</p><p>You can take more strain than you have remaining to resist something. For example, if you have only 1 strain left, you could resist something that would normally cost you 2 or 4 strain.</p><p></p><h2>EFFORT</h2></div></div><p>Effort is a resource used to <strong>Push and Aid.</strong> It is an important resource that should be managed well.</p><p>When you <strong>push yourself during your action roll</strong>, you spend 1 effort to gain +1 boon on your roll.</p><p>When you <strong>aid an ally during their action roll, </strong>you spend 1 effort to grant them +1 boon on their roll.</p><p>There is another way to lose effort. See Breaking.</p><p></p><h2>BREAKING</h2><p>As noted above, when your strain reaches one or more above your maximum or you take critical strain, you <strong>break</strong> and become too hurt or overwhelmed to continue in the current scene, and are unable to move or act on your own.</p><p>When you are <strong>broken, </strong>you must spend 1 effort to take any action. Nearby characters can also spend effort for you. Additionally, when you break, you clear all your strain boxes and take a <strong>burden. </strong>You cease to be broken at the end of the scene and may act normally from then on, though your burden remains.</p><p></p><h2>BURDENS</h2><p><strong>A burden</strong> is more <strong>long-term harm</strong> to a character and represents the mental and physical ordeal of the adventuring life. How much a burden interferes with a character is up to that character’s player. When you take a burden, write the nature of the burden underneath it. It could be a long term injury of some kind that the character ignores, scars, a change in attitude, tiredness, sickness, etc.</p><p>Then, <strong>tick two actions which have more than 0d.</strong> Those action is at at -1d until the burden is healed. Tick actions that are appropriate to the kind of burden taken.</p><p>For example:</p><p>You might tick Smash and Tinker for <strong>a broken arm.</strong></p><p>You might tick Charm and Study for <strong>tiredness.</strong></p><p>You might tick Endure and Traverse for <strong>poisoned.</strong></p><p>You might tick Command and Sense for <strong>fear.</strong></p><p>This can be done up to twice per action.</p><p>The GM can always look to burdens for possible consequences for action rolls. You can also play up your burdens to <strong>invoke</strong> them.</p><p></p><h3>Invoking burdens</h3><p>If a character has any burdens, they can invoke their burdens in narrative play to get into trouble when they make an action roll.</p><p><strong>Get into trouble</strong> means starting trouble or facing consequences, even on a successful roll. For example, a character with the ‘exhausted’ burden decides to get into trouble. The GM decides this character wanders off, not aware of their surroundings, while the party is traversing a monster-infested tunnel. A character with the ‘anger’ burden decides to get into trouble - the GM decides that the character acts out at an inopportune moment.</p><p>When getting into trouble or invoking a burden means changing a character’s behavior or making them act out-of-character, the GM can say broadly what happens but it can be up to the player to act it out.</p><p>Other players are free to suggest consequences for invoking burdens (including the player who invoked them), but it’s ultimately up to the GM what to choose.</p><p>If you invoked a burden at least once during a session <strong>get 1 xp</strong> at the end of that session.</p><p></p><h3>Healing burdens</h3><p>Burdens can only be healed during an interlude, during the special <strong>Heal Burdens</strong> step. Burdens are represented with a filled clock of 4, 6, or 10 segments, and characters can only heal them slowly by unticking segments during downtime. Characters can fill in any burden they like when they take one.</p><p></p><h3>3 burdens</h3><p>A character with 3 burdens can still break, clearing all strain, but doesn’t mark an extra burden. Instead of recovering and returning to themselves at the end of the scene, however, they remain broken until the expedition is over (they can still expend effort to act normally).</p><p>After the expedition is over, any character that broke this way must take their leave from adventuring for a while and <strong>cannot embark on the next expedition.</strong> They can still heal burdens during the interludes and pursue ambitions normally, then return the following expedition if they so choose.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.lgFVQllCGHZgKc3e"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664814844296,"modifiedTime":1686412399145,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"zr2iJeDGRgYVvxHH"}

When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

Only one space in an area of effect is the attack space and requires a roll, the others apply area effects automatically.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>Auras are a continuous, <strong>ongoing</strong> effect that affects all characters within range X of a character, including that character. If a character leaves an aura, that aura's effects immediately end on that character.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: Auto-hit attacks </span>don't require an attack roll but automatically hit. <strong>Auto-hit attacks</strong> <strong>cannot critical hit.</strong></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give characters a <strong>Blessing token</strong>. A character can spend an action and a blessing token to <strong>cure </strong>themselves. All Mendicant jobs also have different ways to use blessings tokens.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> Charge abilities become more powerful or change in some way when used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured can immediately clear a status or blight. Then, if that character is bloodied, they gain vigor 1.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have <strong>two versions</strong>, a base version and combo version. When you use a base combo action, the next time you use any combo action, it uses its Combo version. When you use a Combo version of any combo action, the next combo action uses its base version.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow.</strong></p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> When you attack a bloodied foe, you score a finishing blow, dealing bonus damage. Your abilities with a Finishing Blow effects gain more powerful effects if their primary target is a bloodied foe, even if they are not an attack. Effects depend on the action.</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. For example, if a character is immune to damage or effects, it doesn't even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>Auras are a continuous, <strong>ongoing</strong> effect that affects all characters within range X of a character, including that character. If a character leaves an aura, that aura's effects immediately end on that character.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: Auto-hit attacks </span>don't require an attack roll but automatically hit. <strong>Auto-hit attacks</strong> <strong>cannot critical hit.</strong></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give characters a <strong>Blessing token</strong>. A character can spend an action and a blessing token to <strong>cure </strong>themselves. All Mendicant jobs also have different ways to use blessings tokens.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> Charge abilities become more powerful or change in some way when used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured can immediately clear a status or blight. Then, if that character is bloodied, they gain vigor 1.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have <strong>two versions</strong>, a base version and combo version. When you use a base combo action, the next time you use any combo action, it uses its Combo version. When you use a Combo version of any combo action, the next combo action uses its base version.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow.</strong></p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> When you attack a bloodied foe, you score a finishing blow, dealing bonus damage. Your abilities with a Finishing Blow effects gain more powerful effects if their primary target is a bloodied foe, even if they are not an attack. Effects depend on the action.</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. For example, if a character is immune to damage or effects, it doesn't even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

A character can spend an action and a blessing token to <strong>cure </strong>themselves. All Mendicant jobs also have different ways to use blessings tokens.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> Charge abilities become more powerful or change in some way when used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured can immediately clear a status or blight. Then, if that character is bloodied, they gain vigor 1.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have <strong>two versions</strong>, a base version and combo version. When you use a base combo action, the next time you use any combo action, it uses its Combo version. When you use a Combo version of any combo action, the next combo action uses its base version.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow.</strong></p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> When you attack a bloodied foe, you score a finishing blow, dealing bonus damage. Your abilities with a Finishing Blow effects gain more powerful effects if their primary target is a bloodied foe, even if they are not an attack. Effects depend on the action.</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. For example, if a character is immune to damage or effects, it doesn't even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character.

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save. On a failed save, they stop and cannot move further with the same effect or ability.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Vigor X</strong>: Vigor <span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;display:inline !important;float:none\">grants whoever has it a shield over their HP, the value of which equals X times the target’s VIT.

When you take damage from an ability, pacify breaks.</p><p><strong>Shattered</strong>: Prevents you from gaining or benefiting from vigor.</p><p><strong>Slow</strong>: Forces you to take slow turns.</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Grants +1 boon to attacks made against you.</p><p><strong>Stunned</strong>: You must 1 less action on your next turn, then clear this status at the end of that turn.</p><p><strong>Winded</strong>: Prevents you from teleporting, dashing, and flying.</p><p><strong>Vulnerable</strong>: Increases all damage you take by 1.</p><hr /><p><strong>SPECIAL STATES</strong></p><p><strong>Bloodied</strong>: While you are at 50% or under HP, you are bloodied.</p><p><strong>Immobile</strong>: While immobile, you cannot move in any way.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or  a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow.</strong></p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> When you attack a bloodied foe, you score a finishing blow, dealing bonus damage. Your abilities with a Finishing Blow effects gain more powerful effects if their primary target is a bloodied foe, even if they are not an attack. Effects depend on the action.</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. For example, if a character is immune to damage or effects, it doesn't even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character.

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or  a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow.</strong></p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> When you attack a bloodied foe, you score a finishing blow, dealing bonus damage. Your abilities with a Finishing Blow effects gain more powerful effects if their primary target is a bloodied foe, even if they are not an attack. Effects depend on the action.</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. For example, if a character is immune to damage or effects, it doesn't even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or  a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> When you attack a bloodied foe, you score a finishing blow, dealing bonus damage. Your abilities with a Finishing Blow effects gain more powerful effects if their primary target is a bloodied foe, even if they are not an attack. Effects depend on the action.</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. For example, if a character is immune to damage or effects, it doesn't even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> When you attack a bloodied foe, you score a finishing blow, dealing bonus damage. Your abilities with a Finishing Blow effects gain more powerful effects if their primary target is a bloodied foe, even if they are not an attack. Effects depend on the action.</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. For example, if a character is immune to damage or effects, it doesn't even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage.

Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target.

Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If you have Resistance, you take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character.

For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A.

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities.

They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X.

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p>Sacrifice X: Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A slay effect is an effect found on certain abilities that triggers when those abilities reduce a character to 0 HP. <strong>Slay effects can only trigger once per ability use, by default.</strong></p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> Some abilities bring forth 'Summons'. Summons are characters controlled by their Summoner. Abilities that target allied characters cannot target summons unless otherwise mentioned. Each type of summon has its own unique Summon Action that they use on their summoner's turn, or a Summon Effect that is always active. Otherwise, they don't take actions or movement on their own. By default, summons are size 1, have defense and VIT equal to their summoner's as well as HP equal to their summoner's VIT. When reduced to 0 HP, they are removed from the battlefield instead of becoming defeated. They are also removed if their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. You can teleport even if your speed is 0. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Vigilance.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.7.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1665678202533,"lastModifiedBy":"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413244560,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413246112,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities.

They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability.

Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character.

For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A.

This triggers even on ranged attacks and if you cannot see the foe that damaged you.</p><p><strong>Defiance</strong>: Defiance prevents hit points from being reduced past 1 hp. When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from abilities with the Divine trait (usually Limit Breaks and some other rare abilities) ignores armor, resistance and defiance. It also bypasses vigor.</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>When you have evasion and you are targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4+, the attack automatically misses. This check is made before the attack roll. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities.

Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version.

Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified.

Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn.

Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge.

When this triggers, remove this effect and character becomes immune to all damage for the rest of the current turn.</p><p><strong>Divine</strong>: Damage from this ability cannot be reduced, mitigated, or negated in any way except immunity (ignores armor, weak, resistance, defiance, and bypasses vigor).</p><p><strong>Dodge</strong>: Dodge makes you immune to all damage from misses, successful saves, and area effects.</p><p><strong>Evasion: </strong>Roll a d6 when attacked. On a 4+, the attack automatically misses. Check before the attack roll.. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are immune to all damage and statuses. They are also immune to the Immobile state and do not cause obstruction or engagement.</p><p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing characters can ignore obstructions and pass through, but not end your turn in, characters, terrain or objects.</p><p><strong>Pierce</strong>: Any damage whose source has the pierce trait ignores armor.</p><p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: When you have Regeneration, it grants you vigor 1 at the end of your turn.</p><p><strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Characters with the Skirmisher trait can move diagonally and their dash is at full speed instead of half speed.</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: While you have stealth, you cannot be directly targeted except from an adjacent space. Stealth is broken when you use any ability other than dash.</p><p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: Sturdy characters cannot be stunned or dazed, and reduce the distance of all shoves used on them by 1.</p><p><strong>True Strike</strong>: Abilities with the True Strike trait ignore dodge, blind, evasion and stealth.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable</strong>: Unstoppable characters are immune to all statuses. They are also immune to shoves, as well as the immobilized state and to being teleported by foes.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: Vigilance is a special effect with X charges. All charges of vigilance are lost at the start of your turn. A character can spend a charge of vigilance to enact one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is targeted as part of a foe's ability, shove that ally 1 space towards you. You then become the target of the foe's ability.</p></li><li><p>When a foe attempts to break adjacency with you, you may deal fray damage to them and force them to save.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413336837,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413336837,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413336837,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413336837,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A.

On a 4+, the attack automatically misses. Check before the attack roll.. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities. Effects that don't require a hit and automatically happen go through evasion.</p><p><strong>Flying</strong>: A flying character ignores all terrain, objects, and terrain effects other than impassable terrain, and ignores engagement and obstruction.</p><p><strong>Intangible</strong>: Intangible characters can be targeted, but are Immune to damage and effects from foes.

Cannot be moved by foes, and movement ignores <em>engagement</em> and <em>rampart.</em>.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: A special effect with X charges, each represented by a d6. Like triggered effects, vigilance can only be used once per trigger. </p><p>Vigilance charges stack if a character gains more than one. </p><p>A character can spend any number of charges of Vigilance for one of the following effects, rolling 1d6 per charge spent and picking the highest result:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is damaged by a foe’s ability, reduce the damage by the amount rolled as if with armor</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>When a foe breaks adjacency with you, deal that much damage to them</p></li></ul><p><strong>Vigor X</strong>: Gain a shield that goes over your hit points, equal to your VIT value. Damage goes to Vigor before Hit Points, and it benefits from armor and resistance. Vigor stacks, but cannot go past 25% of your hp. If you gain a vigor surge, gain maximum vigor. Lose all vigor at the end of combat.</p><hr /><p><strong>STATUSES</strong></p><p><strong>Blind</strong>: Reduces the maximum range of all your abilities to 2.</p><p><strong>Dazed</strong>: +1 curse on all of your attack rolls while dazed.</p><p><strong>Hatred of X</strong>: Deal half damage to all foes other than foe X.

Your next ability used ends your turn, then end this status.</p><p><strong>Vulnerable</strong>: Increases all damage you take by 1.</p><p><strong>Weakened:  </strong>All damage dealt reduced by 2.</p><hr /><p><strong>SPECIAL STATES</strong></p><p><strong>Bloodied</strong>: At or under 50% hp.</p><p><strong>Immobile</strong>: Can’t move, be moved, or be removed from the battlefield in any way.</p><p><strong>Incapacitated</strong>:  An incapacitated character doesn’t take turns, doesn’t provide obstruction or engagement, can’t move, take actions, or use abilities or traits. </p><p>All effects on that character end.

Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character.

On a 4+, the attack automatically misses. Check before the attack roll.. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413728559,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

If a player character with 3 woulds would become defeated and gain a 4th wound, they instead die.</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p><strong>Wounds</strong> are fully healed when entering an <strong>interlude, </strong>and can also be healed by some <strong>rare effects</strong>!</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":900000,"name":"Positive Effects/Statuses/Blights/States","type":"text","_id":"PO5vb3MMUI5nNQkT","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>You can make a <strong>save </strong>to end most Statuses.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413847559,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686413847559,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns.

Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition.

For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A.

On a 4+, the attack automatically misses. Check before the attack roll.. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities.

Cannot be moved by foes, and movement ignores <em>engagement</em> and <em>rampart.</em>.</p><p><strong>Vigilance X</strong>: A special effect with X charges, each represented by a d6. Like triggered effects, vigilance can only be used once per trigger. </p><p>Vigilance charges stack if a character gains more than one. </p><p>A character can spend any number of charges of Vigilance for one of the following effects, rolling 1d6 per charge spent and picking the highest result:</p><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>When an ally in range 2 is damaged by a foe’s ability, reduce the damage by the amount rolled as if with armor</p></li></ul><ul class=\"ak-ul\"><li><p>When a foe breaks adjacency with you, deal that much damage to them</p></li></ul><p><strong>Vigor X</strong>: Gain a shield that goes over your hit points, equal to your VIT value.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A.

On a 4+, the attack automatically misses. Check before the attack roll.. Evasion only applies to the attack component of abilities.

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686414286447,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686414757439,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Always reduce by the highest value.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Area Ability:</strong> An ability that applies area effects in a large, fixed pattern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Inter, sans-serif\"><strong>Aura:</strong> </span>This ability is a continuous, <em>ongoing (+)</em> effect that affects all characters specified within range X of an origin point, usually a character. Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686414757439,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}

Characters are only affected by an aura while inside</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong>Auto-Hit</strong>: This attack doesn’t make an attack roll but always scores a hit <strong>(not critical hit or miss)</strong>.</span></p><p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Certain abilities give yourself or allies a <strong>Blessing token</strong>, and ways to spend those tokens for powerful effects. By default a character can use a blessing token to gain +1 boon when they make a save. All blessings are discarded at the end of combat.<strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Charge:</strong> A triggered effect that activates when the ability is used on a slow turn.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> A character that’s cured gains 4 vigor, or a vigor surge if they’re bloodied. Then, they may save agains all statuses.</p><p><strong>Combo:</strong> Actions with Combo have two versions, a base version and combo version. When you use the base ability, gain a <strong>combo token</strong>. Any time you use a combo ability and have a token, you use the combo version instead, discarding the token . You can only have one combo token at once, and discard all tokens at the end of combat.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Comeback</strong>: A triggered effect that turns on if the character using this ability is bloodied</p><p><strong>Cover:</strong> If a character has cover from a ranged attack, it is resistant to that attack, halving all damage. See the 'Cover/Line of Sight' page for details on what exactly constitutes 'having cover'.</p><p><strong>[D]:</strong> Stand-in for your class's damage die. For example, if an ability says it does 2[D]+Fray, and you are a Stormbender, that ability does 2d8+4 damage.</p><p><strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Entering or exiting a dangerous terrain space causes a character to take 2 piercing damage. Characters can only take this damage once a turn.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Costs +1 space of movement to exit.</p><p><strong>Dash:</strong> Dashes are special movement that <strong>ignores engagement.</strong></p><p><strong>Delay:</strong> When you use an ability with a delay effect, your next turn <strong>must be slow. </strong>The effect occurs at the start of that turn, before anything else happens</p><p><strong>End turn</strong>: This ability ends your turn. If multiple abilities or effects would end your turn at the same time, you can only choose one.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: A part of an ability that simply happens and is applied to all targets, no roll or save required</p><p><strong>Engagement:</strong> A character must spend +1 space of movement to exit a space adjacent to a foe.</p><p><strong>Exceed:</strong> A triggered effect that takes place on a total attack roll of 15+.</p><p><strong>Fray:</strong> Stand-in for your class's Fray damage. Fray damage is fixed, and is usually applied on all attacks, <strong>hit or miss.</strong></p><p><strong>Finishing Blow:</strong> Vagabond only. Vagabond only. Triggered effect that triggers if this ability targets a bloodied foe.</p><p><strong>Gamble: </strong>Roll 1d6, then trigger an effect on a certain result or higher</p><p><strong>Heroic</strong>: Stalwart only triggered effect. Triggers when its special condition is fulfilled, depending on job (shove a character, sacrifice health, etc).</p><p><strong>Immune to X:</strong> Not affected by X in any way. A character that’s immune to damage or effects doesn’t even count as taking them.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> A mark is a special effect that can be placed on a character by specific abilities. Each ability grants its mark a unique effect. You can only place one mark at a time on each character and only one of each unique mark can be active at a time. If you place a mark on a character that already has a mark from you, you choose which to keep or discard. Marks end when the character that placed the mark is defeated, or under other conditions unique to each mark. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Melee attack: </strong>For melee attacks, a character must be adjacent to be in range for an attack, unless a higher range is specified. Melee attacks ignore cover.</p><p><strong>Obstruction:</strong> A character can’t move through something that causes obstruction unless they have Phasing. By default, this means <strong>foes, terrain and objects.</strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing (+)</strong>: A status or effect that is ongoing can’t be ended until the thing causing it (a mark, a stance) is ended. Indicated by a + symbol.</p><p><strong>Power Die:</strong> Some abilities will grant you a power die, and tell you to tick it up or untick it depending on certain conditions. Each power die is unique to the ability that granted it. Gain power dice at 1 tick, and if a power die ticks to 0, discard it.</p><p><strong>Ranged attack: </strong>For ranged attacks, a target must have at least 1 space of its area within the listed range of the attack to be a valid target. Make ranged attacks with +1 curse if there’s a foe adjacent to you. Ranged attacks also care about cover.</p><p><strong>Rebound:</strong> An ability that is rebounded can be bounced off a character in range. The ability has no effect, but is instead redirected from that character’s space as the origin space, taking into account cover, line of sight, and other similar effects from their space. Any effects that applyto the original user of the ability still apply to them (such as sacrificing hp, or moving). Rebound does not stack.</p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Take half damage, rounded up.</p><p><strong>Rush X:</strong> Move X spaces. You are unstoppable and immune to all damage while moving.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice X:</strong> Reduce your hp by X, usually as a cost for an ability. Sacrifice costs are paid at the start of an ability, cannot be reduced, ignored, transferred, or resisted, cannot bring your hp below 1, and you can pay them even if you don’thave enough hp left.</p><p><strong>Shove:</strong> Move a character involuntarily X spaces in a straight line away from you. Some abilities may allow you to shove characters in other directions. If a shoved character would move into another character’s space, an object, or a higher level of terrain, they <strong>collide</strong> and stop, taking damage equal to shove amount, which cannot reduce them below 1 hp. Colliding triggers some abilities or traits. Each unique collide effect can only trigger once per turn on each character.</p><p><strong>Slay:</strong> A <em>triggered effect</em> that activates when this ability reduces a character to 0 hp.</p><p><strong>Slow Turn:</strong> Taking a slow turn means you go after all other characters. If multiple characters take slow turns, initiative takes the same order as during regular turns: Ally/Enemy/Ally/Enemy/And so on..</p><p><strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is an ongoing effect granted by certain abilities. A character can only have one stance active at a time and can drop a stance by taking a new stance or as a free action at the start of their turn. When a stance refreshes, you regain its effects.</p><p><strong>Summon:</strong> A character controlled by its Summoner. Summons are intangible, and cannot be marked, and do not count as allies or foes for the purposes of abilities. Summons do not take turns. Instead, they have a <strong>summon action</strong> that they use on their summoner’s turn, or a <strong>summon effect</strong> that is always active, and otherwise don’t take actions or move on their own. Summons are removed from the battlefield when their summoner is defeated.</p><p><strong>Teleport X:</strong> A teleport ability allows its user to instantly move to a free space within range X. <strong>Teleport does NOT ignore Rampart.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrain effect:</strong> A terrain effect is an effect that creates or modifies the terrain spaces on the battlefield in myriad ways.</p><p><strong>Triggered effect</strong> - An effect that actives under a certain condition. Common effects are critical hit, slay, collide, finishing blow, and charge. Each unique effect can only trigger once per ability, and once per trigger</p><hr /><ol><li><p>Blessing tokens are not unique to a character. As long as a character has blessing tokens, they can spend them on any effect granted to them by the presence of a mendicant job</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Combo actions can be interwoven. For example, Ability A and B both have combo. I use ability A, and when I next use ability B I will use its combo version, since I already used a combo move with A. This carries between turns.</p><p>Combo versions of that ability count as the same ability, so you can’t use a base and combo version of the same ability in the same turn.</p></li><li><p>For example, if you used the ability Immolate, which marks an enemy, the next time you used Immolate on a different character, the mark on the first character would fade. If you used a different mark ability on your immolate target, immolate would end on your target.</p></li></ol></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"tXyJLVgERViy4mQ6":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"icon-things","system":"worldbuilding","coreVersion":"10.286","systemVersion":"0.7.1"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ww2NsTPXkqetekYC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldbuilding","systemVersion":"0.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664802759914,"modifiedTime":1686414874201,"lastModifiedBy":"uQ00dS36YYWUuJis"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oTFwOxymQG9qIOAd"}
