The colorful character and card art is very popular with certain circles. Though a basic deck isn’t hard to come by, quality decks of cards are usually beautifully printed and kept by wealthy individuals as a luxury item, with rare cards going for a lot of dust, but they end up making their way down to enthusiast collectors, where there is a healthy secondary market.</p><p>Your Kapkat deck quality is a number from 0-5. If you're a new player, your deck starts at 0. NPCs can also have kapkat decks, and their deck quality is always obvious to you if you play.</p><p>When you play Kapkat with someone else, both players roll their deck quality as a fortune roll. The higher number wins, and in case of ties, go to the second highest number (so 6,6,4 would beat 6,5,2).</p><p>Once a session, someone can play a wagered game of kapkat, which must be done at camp or during an interlude. If you win a game of kapkat, you take 1 dust from the loser. However, the reverse is also true, even with NPCs.</p><p>When you enter a populated location where someone might sell cards, you can buy rare cards to upgrade your deck for 2 dust a rare card. Every 2 rare cards upgrades your deck 1 quality.</p><p>A competitive game of kapkat is played in 3 rounds, with best of 3, and requires at least 1 rare card.
